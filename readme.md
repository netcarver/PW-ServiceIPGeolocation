ServiceIPGeolocation.module
===========================

An IP geolocation module for ProcessWire CMF/CMS by Ryan Cramer.

Uses the [db-ip.com](https://db-ip.com/) geolocation service to lookup geolocation information for a given IP address. You need to register
with db-ip.com and insert your service API key within the module's configuration page to get it to work. (There is a
generous daily look-up allowance even with db-ip's free key.)
